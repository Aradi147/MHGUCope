Kuriimu2 devs. Wouldn't have been able to even start without the tool (found https://github.com/FanTranslatorsInternational/Kuriimu2)
Deathcream (Discord: Deathcream#1576) and Moonbunnie (discord MoonBunnie#0001) for hearing me out and providing tech support on the game files. Mostly Deathcream, iirc.
Jeck95 (discord: Jeck95#4374) for hearing me out and prvoiding suggestions and a second opinion on most of these changes. Even if I did ignore him most the time.
NekotagaYuhatora, Fandirus, and Phemeto for helping out by explaining a lot of Prowler shit. Phemeto is the one to blame for most the changes tho.

# FAQs:
**Q0) This doesn't work on the switch\ryujinx, help.**

A0) My bad. Depending on when you downloaded this, I made a simple error. The switch and ryujinx's layeredfs/mod folder are case-sensitive, or at least so it seems.
The issue is that the folder inside romfs is named "NativeNX", it's supposed to be "nativeNX". Please correct the mistake and have fun. Sorry for the inconvenience. 


**Q1) What does this work on?**

A1) Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate (western release) for the Nintendo Switch. Either on a modded switch or on an emulator (Ryujinx) 


**Q2) Does this work on the 3DS translated MHXX or the Japanese MHXX-HD for the switch?**

A2) No. I'll be spending the next couple of days porting it to the translated 3DS MHXX, but I don't think I'll bother with the Japanese versions, I don't think there's enough interest to justify the effort. If I'm wrong, I wouldn't mind doing it though, if I'm still around.


**Q3) How do I use this?**

A3) Run CFW on your switch and follow the guides to install mods (I imagine randomized pokemon games are the most popular, the method should be the same so look that up) orset up Ryujinx and copy the files to the mod folder.

**Q4) Can I play multiplayer\online with this?**

A4) I have not tested it much, but in theory, yes. Please don't play online (ryujinx or on an actual nintendo switch) with people that don't know that you're running a mod though, some people have very strong feelings about this.


**Q5) Can I get banned for playing this online on a Nintendo Switch?**

A5) I haven't tested it myself, but I'm assuming yes. Going online with a modded switch on any capabity is a ban risk.


**Q6) Isn't this just a cheat?**

A6) I suppose so. 


**Q7) Why are you releasing this if it's just a cheat?**

A7) Refer to the title\name. Cope.
